# Imagen Prompts

## 1. Professional Picture
First ask me for a selfie. Transform my selfie into a fresh but professional image suitable for a social media profile. The lighting should be natural, flattering, and multidimensional. My head is slightly tilted so it doesn't look stiff and it should look like I'm in a modern, bright office with a blurred background.

## 2. 3D Image - Figurine
First ask me to upload an image and then create a 1/7 scale commercialized figurine of the characters in the picture, in a realistic style, in a real environment. The figurine is placed on a compu  ter desk. The figurine has a round transparent acrylic base, with no text on the base. The content on the computer screen is a 3D modeling process of this figurine. Next to the computer screen is a toy packaging box, designed in a style reminiscent of high-quality collectible figures, printed with original artwork. The packaging features two-dimensional flat illustrations.

## 3. 80s Yearbook
You make people's 80s yearbook photos from their image.
Make sure it still looks exactly like their face, but you can change the background, hair, facial hair, and whatever else you think fits the scene. We want that glamour shots vibe (the one from the mall in the 80s), things like mullets, very big and fluffy hair, large glasses, amazing amazing 80s fashion, and of course, that foggy camera and fun backgrounds and soft lighting.
NO TEXT should be in the image.

## 7. Vertical Portrait
Please create a vertical portrait in 1080x1920 format, preserving the subject’s exact facial features. The image should feature stark, cinematic lighting with high contrast. Capture the subject from a slightly low, upward-facing angle to emphasize the jawline and neck, evoking a sense of quiet dominance and sculptural elegance. Use a rich, soft blue background that complements the subject’s eye color, creating a striking contrast with luminous skin tones and a dark wardrobe.

# 11. Victorian 19th century

Directive: Accurately transform the subjects from the uploaded photo into a vintage pop-up Christmas card scene, strictly maintaining the recognizable facial features of all people and animals.
Visual Style & Medium:
A photograph of an open, antique Victorian-era pop-up book. The illustration style is classic watercolor and ink on aged, textured cardstock. The paper should show slight warping, yellowing edges, and a tactile, matte finish.
Subject Treatment (Crucial):
The individuals and animals from the uploaded image are rendered as flat, die-cut cardstock figures.

Faces: Their faces must remain recognizable and distinct as the specific people in the original photo, but rendered with watercolor textures to match the scene.
Attire & Pose: Their bodies are transformed into illustrated figures wearing detailed Victorian/Dickensian winter clothing (e.g., top hats, bonnets, wool coats, mufflers, capes). They are posed naturally within the scene, adapted from their original positions to fit the new era.
Pop-Up Mechanics:
The figures are arranged in layered depth, physically "popped up" from the open book page.

Visible Mechanisms: You must clearly see the physically-plausible mechanics that make them stand and project out as the page opens: paper-fold hinge tabs at their feet glued to the base, supporting paper struts behind them, and visible crease lines where the cardstock folds flat.
Proscenium: A foreground layer of cardstock (cut to look like snow drifts, holly bushes, or an ornate archway) has hinged outwards, framing the bottom of the scene and supporting the projected characters.
Background & Lighting:

Setting: Behind the pop-up figures is a painted watercolor background on the open pages of the book, depicting a Dickensian Christmas street scene at dusk (snowy rooftops, glowing gas lamps, a decorated tree, carolers and such business).
Lighting: Warm, directional studio lighting illuminates the scene, casting soft, realistic shadows from the pop-up cutouts onto the layers behind them, emphasizing the three-dimensional paper construction.
