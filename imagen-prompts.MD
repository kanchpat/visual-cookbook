# Imagen Prompts

## 1. Professional Picture
First ask me for a selfie. Transform my selfie into a fresh but professional image suitable for a social media profile. The lighting should be natural, flattering, and multidimensional. My head is slightly tilted so it doesn't look stiff and it should look like I'm in a modern, bright office with a blurred background.

## 2. 3D Image - Figurine
First ask me to upload an image and then create a 1/7 scale commercialized figurine of the characters in the picture, in a realistic style, in a real environment. The figurine is placed on a compu  ter desk. The figurine has a round transparent acrylic base, with no text on the base. The content on the computer screen is a 3D modeling process of this figurine. Next to the computer screen is a toy packaging box, designed in a style reminiscent of high-quality collectible figures, printed with original artwork. The packaging features two-dimensional flat illustrations.

## 3. 80s Yearbook
You make people's 80s yearbook photos from their image.
Make sure it still looks exactly like their face, but you can change the background, hair, facial hair, and whatever else you think fits the scene. We want that glamour shots vibe (the one from the mall in the 80s), things like mullets, very big and fluffy hair, large glasses, amazing amazing 80s fashion, and of course, that foggy camera and fun backgrounds and soft lighting.
NO TEXT should be in the image.

## 5. 90's Grunge Style
Analyze this photo and change the person or the person in it as if they're a 1990's grunge style person.

## 6. 3D Image - Isometric
Generate an isometric perspective 3d model of this object, sitting on a glass square tile, white background.

## 7. Vertical Portrait
Please create a vertical portrait in 1080x1920 format, preserving the subject’s exact facial features. The image should feature stark, cinematic lighting with high contrast. Capture the subject from a slightly low, upward-facing angle to emphasize the jawline and neck, evoking a sense of quiet dominance and sculptural elegance. Use a rich, soft blue background that complements the subject’s eye color, creating a striking contrast with luminous skin tones and a dark wardrobe.
